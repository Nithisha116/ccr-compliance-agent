CCR Crawl Coverage Report
=========================

Discovered CCR section URLs: 12
Successfully crawled sections: 12
Failed crawls: 0

Coverage status: Partial (Prototype)

Notes:
- This project focuses on validating a complete and robust crawling pipeline.
- Crawl scope was intentionally limited to a small subset of CCR sections
  to demonstrate correctness, hierarchy extraction, retries, and indexing.
- The system is designed to scale horizontally to crawl all CCR sections.

Failure handling:
- Failed URLs are tracked in failed_urls.txt
- Crawl can be resumed safely without re-fetching completed URLs.

Conclusion:
- No silent failures detected
- All discovered URLs were successfully processed
