The benefits are needed because the alien requires medical attention or mental health counseling, or has become disabled, as a result of the battery or extreme cruelty.\n6. The benefits are needed because the loss of a dwelling or source of income or fear of the abuser following separation from the abuser jeopardizes the alien's ability to care for his or her children (e.g., inability to house, feed, or clothe children or to put children into day care for fear of being found by the abuser).\n7. The benefits are needed to alleviate nutritional risk or need resulting from the abuse or following separation from the abuser.\n8. The benefits are needed to provide medical care during a pregnancy resulting from the abuser's sexual assault or abuse of, or relationship with, the alien and/or to care for any resulting children.\n9.

No. 104-193 (PRWORA)), (8 U.S.C. sec. 1621), and notwithstanding any other provision of this division, aliens who are not qualified aliens, nonimmigrant aliens under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. sec. 1101 et seq.), or aliens paroled into the United States under Section 212(d)(5) of the INA (8 U.S.C. sec. 1182(d)(5)) for less than one year, are not eligible to receive loans under the Fishing Fleet Loan program (Fish and Game Code section 9100), except as provided in 8 USCS 1621(c)(2).\n(c) A qualified alien is an alien who, at the time he or she applies for, receives, or attempts to receive a public benefit, is, under Section 431(b) and (c) of the PRWORA (8 U.S.C. sections 1641(b) and (c), any of the following:\n(1) An alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence under the INA (8 U.S.C. sec. 1101 et seq.).\n(2) An alien who is granted asylum under Section 208 of the INA (8 U.S.C. sec. 1158).\n(3) A refugee who is admitted to the United States under Section 207 of the INA (8 U.S.C. sec. 1157).\n(4) An alien who is paroled into the United States under Section 212(d)(5) of the INA (8 U.S.C. sec. 1182(d)(5)) for a period of at least one year.\n(5) An alien whose deportation is being withheld under Section 243(h) of the INA (8 U.S.C. Sec. 1253(h)) (as in effect immediately before the effective date of Section 307 of division C of Public Law 104-208) or Section 241(b)(3) of such Act (8 U.S.C. sec. 1251(b)(3)) (as amended by Section 305(a) of division C of Public Law 104-208).\n(6) An alien who is granted conditional entry pursuant to Section 203(a)(7) of the INA as in effect prior to April 1, 1980.

The benefits are needed due to a loss of financial support resulting from the alien's separation from the abuser.\n4. The benefits are needed because the battery or cruelty, separation from the abuser, or work absences or lower job performance resulting from the battery or extreme cruelty or from legal proceedings relating thereto (including resulting child support, child custody, and divorce actions) cause the alien to lose his or her job or to earn less or to require the alien to leave his or her job for safety reasons.\n5. The benefits are needed because the alien requires medical attention or mental health counseling, or has become disabled, as a result of the battery or extreme cruelty.\n6. The benefits are needed because the loss of a dwelling or source of income or fear of the abuser following separation from the abuser jeopardizes the alien's ability to care for his or her children (e.g., inability to house, feed, or clothe children or to put children into day care for fear of being found by the abuser).\n7. The benefits are needed to alleviate nutritional risk or need resulting from the abuse or following separation from the abuser.\n8.

For purposes of this subsection, the term “battered or subjected to extreme cruelty” includes, but is not limited to being the victim of any act or threatened act of violence including any forceful detention, which results or threatens to result in physical or mental injury. Rape, molestation, incest (if the victim is a minor), or forced prostitution shall be considered as acts of violence.\n(B) The alien did not actively participate in such battery or cruelty.\n(C) There is a substantial connection between such battery or cruelty and the need for the benefits to be provided in the opinion of the Office of Planning and Research.

For purposes of this subsection, the term “battered or subjected to extreme cruelty” includes, but is not limited to, being the victim of any act or threatened act of violence including any forceful detention, which results or threatens to result in physical or mental injury. Rape, molestation, incest (if the victim is a minor), or forced prostitution shall be considered acts of violence.\n(B) There is a substantial connection between such battery or cruelty and the need for the benefits to be provided in the opinion of the Office of Planning and Research.

With regard to naturalized citizens and derivative citizens presenting certificates of citizenship and aliens, the INS is the appropriate government entity to contact for verification. The Office of Planning Research shall request verification from the INS by filing INS Form G-845 with copies of the pertinent documents provided by the applicant with the local INS office. If the applicant has lost his or her original documents or presents expired documents or is unable to present any documentation evidencing his or her immigration status, the applicant shall be referred to the local INS office to obtain documentation.\n(5) The type of documentation referred to the INS for verification pursuant to INS Form G-845 shall include the following:\n(A) The document presented indicates immigration status but does not include an alien registration or alien admission number.\n(B) The document is suspected to be counterfeit or to have been altered.\n(C) The document includes an alien registration number in the A60 000 000 (not yet issued) or A80 000 000 (illegal border crossing) series.\n(D) The document is one of the following: an INS Form I-181b notification letter issued in connection with an INS Form I-181 Memorandum of Creation of Record of Permanent Residence, an Arrival-Departure Record (INS Form I-94) or a foreign passport stamped “PROCESSED FOR I-551, TEMPORARY EVIDENCE OF LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENCE” that INS issued more than one year before the date of application for a loan under the Fishing Fleet Loan program (Fish and Game Code section 9100).\n(6) If the INS advises that the applicant has citizenship status or immigration status which makes him or her a qualified alien, a nonimmigrant or alien paroled for less than one year under section 212(d)(5) of the INA, the INS verification shall be accepted. If the INS advises that it cannot verify that the applicant has citizenship status or an immigration status that makes him or her a qualified alien, a nonimmigrant or an alien paroled for less than one year under section 212(d)(5) of the INA, benefits shall be denied and the applicant notified pursuant to the regular procedures of the Fishing Fleet Loan program (Fish and Game code section 9100) as may be applicable, of his or her rights to appeal the denial of benefits.\n(f) Pursuant to Section 434 of the PRWORA (8 U.S.C. sec. 1644), where the Office of Planning and Research reasonably believes that an alien is unlawfully in the State based on the failure of the alien to provide reasonable evidence of the alien's declared status, after an opportunity to do so, said alien shall be reported to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n(g) Provided that the alien has completed and signed the “Statement of Citizenship, Alienage, and Immigration Status for State Public Benefits,” Form under penalty of perjury, eligibility for the Fishing Fleet Loan program (Fish and Game Code 9100), shall not be delayed, denied, reduced or terminated while the status of the alien is verified.\n(h) Pursuant to Section 432(d) of the PRWORA (8 U.S.C. sec. 1642(d)), a nonprofit charitable organization that provides federal, state or local public benefits shall not be required to determine, verify, or otherwise require proof of eligibility of any applicant or beneficiary with respect to his or her immigration status or alienage.\n(i) The Director shall notify the applicant by certified letter that the applicant is ineligible for a public benefit pursuant to subsections (b) and (e), or that the public benefit is terminated or suspended pursuant to subsections (b) and (e). The letter shall include the following:\n(1) The name and address of the applicant.\n(2) The reason for the ineligibility and/or termination or suspension of the public benefit.\n(3) A copy of Section 4001, Title 10, California Code of Regulations.\n(4) A statement informing the applicant that he or she has the right to request a hearing to contest the Director's decision pursuant to the procedure described in subsection (j).\n(j) An applicant who has been denied a loan in any of the above enumerated programs based solely on the applicant's immigration status, may request a hearing to appeal that decision. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be submitted to the Director of the Office of Planning and Research no later than fifteen (15) calendar days following the mailing of the subsection (i) letter. The hearing shall be conducted as follows:\n(1) The applicant shall have the right to be represented by legal counsel at the hearing.\n(2) The proceedings of the hearing shall be recorded by an electronic tape recording system.\n(3) At the hearing the Office's representative and the applicant may make statements and submit evidence regarding the applicant's eligibility.\n(4) The Director or his or her designee may ask the Office's representative and the applicant questions regarding the applicant's eligibility.\n(5) At or within 10 days following the conclusion of the hearing, the Director or his or her designee shall make a decision which contains findings or reasons for the decision.\n(6) The Office shall provide the applicant, by certified mail, a copy of the Director's or his or her designee's decision.\n(7) The applicant may request judicial review by filing a writ of mandate in accordance with provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.\n## Credits\nNote: Authority cited: Section 14024, Corporations Code; Sections 15330(b) and 15399.16, Government Code; and 16 U.S.C.

The Fair Political Practices Commission has adopted a regulation (2 California Code of Regulations Section 18730) which contains the terms of a standard conflict of interest code, which can be incorporated by reference in an agency's code. After public notice and hearing it may be amended by the Fair Political Practices Commission to conform to amendments in the Political Reform Act. Therefore, the terms of 2 California Code of Regulations Section 18730 and any amendments to it duly adopted by the Fair Political Practices Commission are hereby incorporated by reference into Section 4200 (a copy of section 18730 is attached hereto). Section 4200 and the attached Appendixes, designating officials and employees and establishing disclosure categories, shall constitute the conflict of interest code of the California Trade and Commerce Agency, “Agency”.\nDesignated employees identified in Appendix A, shall file statements of economic interests with the Agency. Upon receipt of the statement of the Secretary of the Agency, “Secretary”, the Agency shall make and retain a copy and forward the original of this statement to the Fair Political Practices Commission. Statements for all other designated employees will be retained by the Agency.\nPROHIBITION ON HONORARIA\nBoard members and designated employees of the Agency are prohibited from accepting any honorarium from any source which the board member or employee would be required to report as a source of income, loans, or gifts on his or her statement of economic interests.\n“Honorarium” means, except as provided below, any payment made in consideration for any speech given, article published, or attendance at any public or private conference, convention, meeting, social event, meal, or like gathering.\n“Honorarium” does not include earned income for personal services which are customarily provided in connection with the practice of a bona fide business, trade, or profession, such as teaching, practicing law, medicine, insurance, real estate, banking, or building contracting, unless the sole or predominant activity of the business, trade, or profession is making speeches. Honorarium also does not include income for personal services which are unconnected to the scope of the work of the employee's employment with the Agency.\nLIMIT ON GIFTS\nBoard members and designated employees of the Agency are prohibited from receiving gifts with a total value of more than the amount specified in 2 California Code of Regulations, Section 18730 from any single source which the board member or designated employee is required to report as a source of income, loans, or gifts on his or her statement of economic interests.\nThe limit on gifts specified in 2 California Code of Regulations, Section 18730 does not apply to the following:\n(1) Payments, advances, or reimbursements for travel and related lodging and subsistence permitted by Government Code Section 89506;\n(2) Wedding gifts and gifts exchanged between individuals on birthdays, holidays, and other similar occasions, provided that the gifts exchanged are not substantially disproportionate in value; and\n(3) The general exceptions provided in Government Code Section 82028(b) and Title 10, Chapter 7, Article 8 of California Code of Regulations.\n**Appendix--A**\nDesignated Employees\nIt has been determined that the following positions have responsibilities for the making of decisions or for participating in the making of decisions which may have a foreseeable, material effect on financial interests. The designated employees shall disclose in their statement of economic interest those financial interests which are of the kind described in the disclosure category to which they are assigned in Appendix B.\nDesignated Positions:\n1.

If the Agency hires an entity to do consulting work, the natural person(s) selected by the entity to provide the consulting services shall be covered by this section. The term consultant does not include a person who: 1) conducts research and arrives at conclusions with respect to his or her rendition of information, advice, recommendation or counsel independent of the control and direction of the Agency or any Agency official, other than normal contract monitoring; and 2) possesses no authority with respect to any Agency decision beyond the rendition of information, advice, recommendation or counsel (disclosure categories I, II, and III).\nConsultants shall be included in the list of designated employees and shall disclose pursuant to the broadest disclosure category in the code subject to the following limitation:\nThe Secretary, or his or her designee(s), may determine in writing that a particular consultant is hired to perform a range of duties that is limited in scope and thus is not required to fully comply with the disclosure requirements in this section. Such written determination shall include a description of the consultant's duties and, based upon that description, a statement of the extent of disclosure requirements. The Secretary's determination is a public record and shall be retained for public inspection in the same manner and location as this conflict of interest code.\n**Appendix--B**\nDisclosure Categories\nCategory I: Individuals assigned to this category shall disclose all investments and business positions in business entities, interests in real property, and sources of income as well as business positions in and income from nonprofit organizations of the type which may be recipients of contracts, grants, loans, or loan guarantees from the California Trade and Commerce Agency.\nCategory II: Individuals assigned to this category shall disclose all investments and business position in, and income from any business entity of the type to contract with the California Trade and Commerce Agency to provide equipment, supplies, or services or to receive services, grants, loans or loan guarantees, or participate in any of the programs administered by the Agency.\nCategory III: Individuals assigned to this category shall disclose all investments and business positions in, and income from, any business entity of the type to participate in any of the programs administered by the California Trade and Commerce Agency or which engages in real estate transactions (including all interest in real property zoned commercial or industrial), construction development, investment brokering, or similar activities.\n## Credits\nHistory\n1.

The Office shall be authorized in a Solicitation to limit the amount for which the Office shall provide matching funds.\n(b) A Solicitation shall be mailed to every Person requesting a copy.\n(c) All Proposals received by the due date and place specified in the Solicitation shall be reviewed to determine eligibility pursuant to section 5472. Applicants shall include in the Proposal package both a signed original and five copies of the Proposal. Only eligible Proposals shall be scored.\n(d) The Solicitation shall describe the Region covered by each Alliance. The Proposal shall be mailed to the Alliance covering the Region where the Applicant's Project will take place. If a Project will take place in a Region not covered by an Alliance, or is statewide in nature, the proposal shall be mailed to the Office. As used in this subsection, “statewide in nature” means that a substantial portion of the Project will take place in more than one Region.\n(e) The Alliances and Office shall review the Proposals assigned to each for eligibility, and evaluate and score the eligible Proposals according to the Section 5474 criteria. No two proposals shall receive the same score. Alliances and Funding Agencies shall be included as nonvoting participants in the Office review, and the Office and Funding Agencies shall be included as nonvoting participants in the Alliance reviews.\n(f) The Alliances and the Office shall forward to the Office all eligible Proposals scoring a minimum of 25 points.\n(g) The Office shall establish review panels approved by the Council, including a nonvoting representative from each Alliance and two or more voting members, including one or more representatives from Funding Agencies. The review panels shall review the Proposals forwarded by the Alliances and the Office and make a single, consolidated, ranked list of Proposals complying with Section 5475(a) and is ranked according to Section 5475(b) criteria. The list shall only include Proposals for which funding is available, based upon Proposals scoring the most points. If two or more proposals near the bottom of the ranking have identical scores and if there is money to fund some but not all identically ranked proposals, then there shall be oral interviews. The purpose of the oral interviews is to re-rank the tied proposals.\n(h) The Office shall forward to the Council and the Alliances the proposed funding list, with a short description of each Proposal on that list. The description shall address each of the subsection (i)(1) through (3) items. Proposals will be sent to the Council upon request.\n(i) No later than 60 days following the deadline for submitting Proposals, the Council shall recommend funding for those Proposals receiving the highest ranking from the review panel, unless the Council finds that changes to the ranking are necessary due to:\n(1) Failure of the Proposal to score sufficient Section 5475 points to receive funding;\n(2) Conflict of interest as defined by Government Code Sections 1090 or 87100 et seq.; or\n(3) Lack of geographic diversity.\n(j) The Council shall remove from the ranking any Proposal which: lacks geographic diversity, includes a conflict of interest or fails to score sufficient Section 5475 points to receive funding. The Council shall specify which standard has not been met and shall fund the next highest ranking proposal(s) which meet the subsection (i)(1) through (3) criteria.\n(k) The Council shall make the recommendation in writing by mailing notification to the Applicant, the Office, the Funding Agency and the Alliances.\n(_l_) Following the Council recommendation of a Proposal which requested Office funding, the Office and the successful Applicant shall enter into a Grant Agreement on terms mutually acceptable to all parties.\n(m) At the Council funding meeting, an Alliance shall be authorized to appeal to the Council a review panel Proposal ranking or finding of eligibility. The Council shall overturn the ranking only if it finds clear and convincing evidence that the finding or ranking was unsubstantiated.\n## Credits\nNote: Authority cited: Section 8456, Government Code.
